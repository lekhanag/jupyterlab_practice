Create a Jupyter Notebook called question11.ipynb that contains the following cells:
A markdown cell with a level 1 heading

A markdown cell that includes the equation of the mean written in Latex

step 2: 
Create a Jupyter notebook called question12.ipynb containing the following cells:
A markdown cell containing some text
